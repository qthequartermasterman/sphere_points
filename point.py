            It looks like it may be impossible to get a perfect even distribution of points on a sphere for a general N. 
            Exact solutions seem to only exist for N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20. Every paper that I have read show that 
            any approximation algorithm still has areas that are uneven for any other values.
            
            Finding the arrangement that minimizes the max-distance between two points is sometimes called the 
            "Tammes Problem" or "Spherical Covering". The "Thomson Problem" is similar, but uses energy instead of 
            distance as the metric.
            
            As of 2015, the problem is only solved for N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14
            
            The proof for N=14 requires complicated graph theory and topology.

            For 3-spheres and larger, we can slowly, non-deterministically, yet still practically approach somewhat of 
            a stable solution. Start with randomly placing points across the n-sphere, then maximize the minimum l2 
            distance of the points. This rarely finds an exact solution (likely since they don't exist), but seems to
            always get close.
            
            For 3-spheres and larger, this problem gets REALLY hard. I am still trying to wrap my head around this case.
            I cannot find any resources that show that there are ANY exact solutions for large n-spheres. A lot of the 
            literature on this problem is applied to error codes and code correction, so I'm having to learn a lot.
            
            In general this problem is called the "Spherical Code Problem". A spherical code is a list of parameters 
            (n, N, t) where n = num_dimensions, N = num_points, and t is the maximum dot product (cosine distance) 
            between two points.
